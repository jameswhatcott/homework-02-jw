# My Portfolio Website

## Description

This is a portfolio website to display all my work for different websites and applications that I've created. I thought this would be really good to share with employeres and other colleagues on what I do to show my skills. This website will be continuously updated to make it prettier and have more updated content.

## Usage

Just go to the website and start viewing the different applications or reading the About Me section.
