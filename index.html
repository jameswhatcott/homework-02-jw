                <p>
                    I'm an aspiring web developer based in Lufkin Texas who's excited to build tools of value for companies and organizations that stand in need of them. I'm married, with two beautiful children. I'm a proud member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Outside of coding, I like to participate in theatre and drama whether it be watching or performing myself. I love to sing as well.
